# nepomodz Script

Welcome to the **nepomodz Script** repository! This project is a Python-based script designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how web servers, camera access, and location tracking work. Please read this document carefully before using the script.

---

## **Description**

This script consists of two main components:

1. **Python Flask Server (`nepomodz_server.py`)**:
   - Creates a local web server.
   - Requests access to the user's camera.
   - If access is granted, it captures images continuously and saves them to the `captured_images` directory.

2. **Termux Execution Script (`nepomodz_script.sh`)**:
   - Guides you through the setup process in Termux.
   - Lists all required packages and installation commands.
   - Clones this repository and runs the Python server.

## **Features**

- **Educational Use**: Demonstrates how web servers and browser permissions work.
- **Camera Access**: Captures images if the user grants camera access.
- **Continuous Capture**: Captures images every second while the user is on the page.
- **Termux Integration**: Works seamlessly in Termux with storage and camera access.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Run the Script in Termux**:
   ```bash
   bash nepomodz_script.sh
   ```

3. **Access the Webpage**:
   - Open the provided link in a browser (e.g., `http://<your-ip>:5000`).
   - If the user grants camera access, images will be captured and saved.

4. **Check Captured Images**:
   - Images are saved in the `captured_images` directory.

## **Required Packages**

The script requires the following packages:

### **Termux Packages (`pkg`)**:
- `python`
- `git`

### **Python Libraries (`pip`)**:
- `flask`
- `requests`

## **Educational Purpose**

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Examples of ethical use include:
- Learning how web servers work.
- Understanding how browser permissions (camera, location) are handled.
- Experimenting with Python, Flask, and browser-based image capture.
